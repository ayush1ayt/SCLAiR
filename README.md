The folder "Recorded_preprocessed_data" contains the data recorded in our lab after preprocessing. 

The folder "Subject_wise_data3" contains the publicly available dataset (from http://bigdatalab.tau.ac.il/shared-resources/) after preprocessing. 

The implementation of supervised contrastive learning is inspired from https://keras.io/examples/vision/supervised-contrastive-learning/
